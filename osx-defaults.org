#+TITLE: OSX Sensible Defaults
#+BABEL: :results none :exports code

This file is strictly for setting up my OSX environment the way I like it, but it's documented to the point that you can cherry pick what you'd like! 

* Preflight

There are a few things we need to do that we'll use later, such as creating a directory for screenshots
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  mkdir -p ~/Documents/screenshots
#+END_SRC

* OSX Defaults

** Screenshots

I hate for my desktop to be cluttered by screenshots (I take a lot of them), so I want to put them in =~/Documents/screenshots=:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  defaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Documents/screenshots;
#+END_SRC

I'm not a fan of the shadow around screenshots, so I like to disable it:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  defaults write com.apple.screencapture disable-shadow -bool TRUE;
#+END_SRC

change the screenshot type to png:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  defaults write com.apple.screencapture type png
#+END_SRC

** Desktop

I like for my desktop to /always/ look clean, even if I happened to accidentally put junk on it:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop false
#+END_SRC

Kill all the OSX services that run this stuff so we can have it all take effect:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  killall SystemUIServer
  killall Finder
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
