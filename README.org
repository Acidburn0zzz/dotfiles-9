This is the source for my dotfiles: =org= files that generate configuration through tangle (or evaluate buffers) with Emacs.

* Introduction 

Since I first discovered =org-mode= (and Emacs for that matter), I knew that I'd been doing dotfiles all wrong. One of the most important aspects of writing software or programming to me is the ability to articulate what I'm doing /first/ then to write the code. My dotfiles (as most other dotfiles) were a garbled, cobbled together mess. 

Sure, my dotfiles could be easily reproduced by me on a new machine, but if someone wanted to use my dotfiles for learning or reason about what it was doing, well...good luck.

So I decided to give this literate programming thing a whirl, knowing that I could generate files for all of my dotfiles /from/ =*.org= files, the worst case scenario is I'd end up right back where I started. 

If you're unfamiliar with literate programming, you can read [[http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf][Donald Knuth's paper on literate programming here]]. 

This [[https://gitlab.com/chaseadamsio/dotfiles][entire dotfiles repository]] is now written with literate programming, with the only dependency being Emacs version 25. Armed with only an editor that's been around since the 70's I can describe my entire system state through documentation (org file content) and the /actual/ code (org file source blocks). Everything you'll find here is an [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode file]] that is either evaluated by Emacs at runtime (such as my [[./emacs.org][=emacs.org=]]) or tangled with [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html][babel]] source code blocks (such as my [[./shell.org][shell.org]].

With that, everything starts in [[./bootstrap.org][bootstrap.org]]. If you're still interested in groking my dotfiles, that's the best place to start. Enjoy your journey!

My Dotfiles weren't a sole, Herculean task, but rather a composiion of what I've learned from others. You can find an exhaustive list of the people I'm grateful for at [[./acknowledgements.org][acknowledgements.org]] as well as a list of links to the blog posts, dotfiles and Emacs configurations I used to get [[https://dotfiles.chaseadams.io][my Dotfiles]] to where they are.
* Backlog
** TODO add a function that takes an *.org file path and evaluates the source code blocks the same way that =init.el= does for =emacs-lisp=.
