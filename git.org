Make sure that whenever I look at my =~/.gitconfig= I remember that it's been generated by emacs!

setup some useful =git= aliases... 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  [alias]
    b = branch 
    rv = remote -v 
    s = status -sb 
    st = status 
    d = diff

#+END_SRC

Setup the default editor to be emacs:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  [core]
    editor = emacs
#+END_SRC

Configure =git= to output colors and configure the colors for diff subcommands: 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  [color]
          # Use colors in Git commands that are capable of colored output when
          # outputting to the terminal. (This is the default setting in Git e 1.8.4.)
          ui = auto

  [color "branch"]
          current = yellow reverse
          local = yellow
          remote = green

  [color "diff"]
          meta = yellow bold
          frag = magenta bold # line info
          old = red # deletions
          new = green # additions

  [color "status"]
          added = yellow
          changed = green
          untracked = cyan
#+END_SRC

Detect renames of files for basic renames and copies:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  [diff]
          # Detect copies as well as renames
          renames = copies
#+END_SRC

Make it easy on me and automatically correct commads I mistype:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  [help]
          autocorrect = 1
#+END_SRC
