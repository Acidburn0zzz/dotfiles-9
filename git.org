#+TITLE: My Git Config

* .gitconfig
:PROPERTIES:
:tangle: ~/.gitconfig
:END:

Make sure that whenever I look at my =~/.gitconfig= I remember that it's been generated by emacs!
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
###### HEY BUDDY, DON'T FORGET THAT THIS FILE HAS BEEN AUTOGENERATED!!! ######
#+END_SRC

setup some useful =git= aliases... 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  [alias]
    b = branch 
    rv = remote -v 
    s = status -sb 
    st = status 
    d = diff 
    co = checkout 
    com = checkout master 
    f = fetch 
    l = log 
    a = add 
    ap = add --patch 
    c = commit 
    p = push 
    clean = checkout -f -- 
    dirty = reset --hard 
#+END_SRC

Setup the default editor to be emacs:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  [core]
    editor = emacs
#+END_SRC

Configure =git= to output colors and configure the colors for diff subcommands: 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  [color]
          # Use colors in Git commands that are capable of colored output when
          # outputting to the terminal. (This is the default setting in Git e 1.8.4.)
          ui = auto

  [color "branch"]
          current = yellow reverse
          local = yellow
          remote = green

  [color "diff"]
          meta = yellow bold
          frag = magenta bold # line info
          old = red # deletions
          new = green # additions

  [color "status"]
          added = yellow
          changed = green
          untracked = cyan
#+END_SRC

Detect renames of files for basic renames and copies:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  [diff]
          # Detect copies as well as renames
          renames = copies
#+END_SRC

Make it easy on me and automatically correct commads I mistype:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  [help]
          autocorrect = 1
#+END_SRC

anything that needs to be unique to a specific environment (user email and name, for instance) should live here and it'll be included. 

Big thanks to [[http://agateau.com/2015/splitting-your-gitconfig/][Aurélien Gâteau's post on Includes in a git config] for explaining that the way to test this should be:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  git config --global --includes user.email
#+END_EXAMPLE


#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  [include]
          path = ~/.gitconfig.local
#+END_SRC
