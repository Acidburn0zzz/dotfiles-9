#+TITLE: Registers

Registers are a convenient way to access frequently opened files in a quick manner.

You can access a register by typing =C-x r j= followed by the letter in the =set-register ?= to jump to that file.

** Register for opening =[[file:init.org][init.org]]=
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (set-register ?e (cons 'file (caio-dotfiles-join "init")))
#+END_SRC

** register for opening =dotfiles=
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (set-register ?d (cons 'file dotfiles-dir))
#+END_SRC
