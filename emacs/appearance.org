#+TITLE: Appearance

Disable the audible bell (I'm smart, I can figure out when I've done something wrong) and disable all the chrome for the emacs external application.

Use Fira Mono, set the line height and shrink the font to 9pt.

I like my cursor to be a thin line rather than a chunky block. I've always found the chunky block to be distracting.

One of the things I dislike about emacs is when you select some text and want to replace it with other text the way you would in a sane editor, it leaves the selected text and places the cursor at the end of the selection and starts typing. This "fixes" that so that when I select text and start to type, it replaces the selected text with my newly typed words.
