This is a list of the folks who've helped me make my dotfiles become what they are.

* Emacs

** Sacha Chua
[[http://sachachua.com/blog/][Sacha Chua]] is likely the person who I've gleaned the most about Emacs from, especially [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/01/tips-learning-org-mode-emacs/][=org-mode=.]] [[http://pages.sachachua.com/.emacs.d/Sacha.html][Sacha's dotfiles]] are easily the most descriptive and helpful dotfiles I've found & have been a major factor to me sticking to Emacs.
